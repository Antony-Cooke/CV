            <h3>Royal Bank of Scotland</h3>
            <h4>14 September 2000 – 31 March 2002</h4>
            <h6>Employed as an Analyst / Programmer on the Mortgage Scaling Project.</h6>
            <h6>Objective of the Scaling Team was to remove unnecessary hard coding from COBOL Programs, to identify methods of improving the efficiency of Programs and to improve the Run-times of Jobs in the overnight Batch Suite for the Mortgage Manager System.</h6>
            <h6>The purpose of this work was to ensure that when Natwest’s data is migrated over to the Mortgage Manager System, that the daily batch suite would be able to run in the available window.</h6>
            <h6>As part of this team, I took an active and principal role in the following tasks.</h6>
            <h6>Investigated the entire Mortgage System with a view to identifying Interfaces, both in and out.</h6>
            <h6>These vary in nature. There are Flat files, VSAM Files, DB2 Tables and unloaded DB2 Tables.</h6>
            <h6>The removal of hard-coded references was achieved by replacing them with accesses to a DB2 table.</h6>
            <h6>Amending programs and jobs to enable processing in parallel streams.</h6>
            <h6>After Identifying and documenting all of the Mortgage Manager Interfaces, I made the necessary Program changes to ensure more efficient running.  This included work on Sort Exit processing as well as running programs against partitioned DB2 Tables and bringing multiple files back together into one extract file afterwards.</h6>
            <h6>Some Data Integrity issues were identified in the comprehensive Volume testing stage of the Development cycle.  These issues were also found in the Live data and it was my responsibility to document them, pass the information on to the Production Support Team and to develop some Jobs to be run on a regular basis to identify when new issues arise.</h6>
            <h6>It fell to the Production Support team to identify solutions to these issues through Data Fixes and Program changes and to implement them.</h6>
            <h6>I was also involved in the Unit, System, Volume and User Acceptance Testing of all scaling functions, the support of them and in the liaison with downstream systems in order to ensure a smooth conversion of data from the Natwest UFSS system onto Mortgage Manager.</h6>
            <h6>This contract was initially for 9 months followed by a six-month and then a three-month extension.</h6>
